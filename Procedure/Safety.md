## Safety Policy

Safety at HSBNE is an important consideration given many of our members are not trained professionals using a tool they use in everyday use. Without considering Safety we cannot provide all of the wonderful machines and tooling we have available under clear conscience.

## General Safety Expectations
It is expected of Members that they:
* Consider the safety of not just themselves but of those in the immediate vicinity before taking an action that may be considered unsafe.
* Communicate clearly to Members or Guests why an action they are taking or about to take is unsafe and any steps they can take to resolve this.
* Follow the recommendations of PPE signage around the HSBNE Inc Port Hack Facility.
* Wear enclosed footwear on the entirety of the HSBNE Inc Port Hack Facility.
* Do not use equipment at HSBNE unless they have completed a Membership Induction.
* Do not use equipment at HSBNE that requires an Induction unless they have completed said Induction.

## Personal Protective Equipment - PPE
At HSBNE the use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is greatly encouraged if not required as an injured hacker cannot hack.

All areas in HSBNE that have been identified to require PPE when using the tooling within are marked with Australian Standard Mandatory PPE signage. If you encounter any that require signage you are expected to let the HSBNE Executive know.
