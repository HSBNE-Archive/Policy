## Exclusive use of space at HSBNE

Exclusive use of space was allowed by [the meeting on 30th August, 2010](http://hsbne.org/admin/meeting/20110830.html) 
and was revoked by [the meeting on 20th of August, 2013](http://hsbne.org/admin/meeting/20130820.md).

As such, it is HSBNE policy to disallow exclusive use of space agreements for portions of the PortHack Campus.
